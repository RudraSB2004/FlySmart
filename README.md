# ✈️ FlySmart – Flight Price Prediction  
### First Machine Learning Project by Rudra

---

## 📌 Overview  
FlySmart is my **first end-to-end Machine Learning project**, where I built an ML model and integrated it with a modern **React frontend** and a **Flask backend API**.

For experienced developers this may look simple,  
but for me — building the ML model, connecting Flask, and integrating React — was a big milestone.  
It taught me how full ML pipelines work in real projects.

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

### **Frontend**
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons

### **Backend**
- Flask  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  

### **Model**
- Trained ML model for flight price prediction  
- Saved as `model.pkl`

## 🎯 Features  
- Predicts price based on airline, cities, stops, class, and time  
- Clean modern UI  
- Fast Flask API  
- Fully integrated ML pipeline  
- Responsive user interface

## 🧠 What I Learned  
- Building and training ML models  
- Saving & loading models with Pickle  
- Creating API endpoints with Flask  
- Connecting React frontend to Flask backend  
- Managing state and API calls  
- Organizing a full ML project structure  

This project may be basic for some,  
but for me it was a **huge confidence boost** and a great start to ML web integration.
